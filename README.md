# MSw
Hello World!
this is my first project using python after 1st year course in CS.
As a surfer and a student who live in Beer-sheva,
I wanted to create a way to be informed about a good condiotions for surfing to the upcoming weekend,
without the need to check it myself.
Using Msw's api to collect data about the sea conditions in Tel-Aviv,
I was able to decide if some conditions are good enough for sending myself a message using telegrm's bot.
The free period in both AWS and Heroku were ended so curretnly this script not in use.
All you need is a key from MSW and a telegram bot!
Feel free to ask question about the script.
